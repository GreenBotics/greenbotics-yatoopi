## Airlift pump, first success


#### 2015 Jan 13

So , finally got around to testing of **model A0** *


- raw data
  0.10 L in 6 mins 28,37s 

  ie 0.10L in 388.37s aka 0.015 / min aka 0.92L /h
  
  //old stuff : 6.47283333 mins => 0.0154 L * min-1

- notes: 
  first sucessfull & reproducible test, other air pump (P1 , 100L/H) seems to be half dead
  (ie even attaching a simple bubbler and putting it in water hardly produces any air bubbles)
