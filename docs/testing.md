Pump and airlilft designs testing
=================================

###Goals

  For now , for an indoor, relatively small setup : 
  
  - 60 L aquarium, fish species not decided yet, could be too small for Tilapias
  - 80 x 40 X 10 aprox grow bed, home built, wood & 3d printed parts: more on this later
  - two 13w neon tubes (bathroom variety, will post more specs)
  - aquarium is 60 cm below the grow bed, so any pumping system needs to be able to lift water up to that height *at least*

Bought Pumps 
------------

- 3W air pump  : 60L / h (id: P0)
- 6W air pump  : 100L /h (id: P1) **KO**
- 3.5W air pump: 200L /h (id: p2)
