Pump and airlilft designs testing
=================================

###Goals

  For now , for an indoor, relatively small setup : 
  
  - 60 L aquarium, fish species not decided yet, could be too small for Tilapias
  - 80 x 40 X 10 aprox grow bed, home built, wood & 3d printed parts: more on this later
  - two 13w neon tubes (bathroom variety, will post more specs)
  - aquarium is 60 cm below the grow bed, so any pumping system needs to be able to lift water up to that height *at least*
  
  
#Pumps

Bought Pumps 
------------

- 3W air pump : 60L / h (id: P0)
- 6W air pump: 100L /h  (id: P1) **KO**


Built pumps

- nothing conclusive so far, work in progress

*Testing of **model A0** *

- raw data
  0.10 L in 6 mins 28,37s 

  ie 0.10L in 6.47283333 mins => 0.0154 L * min-1

- notes: 
  first sucessfull & reproducible test, other air pump (100L/H) seems to be half dead
