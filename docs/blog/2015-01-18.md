## Airlift pump, continued (3)

#### 2015 Jan 18


I tested with 6 mm tube and the printed ##XXXX 

Tested with 200L/h Eheim air pump with **both outlets
set to 50l/h** : I had to reduce it to minimal levels
as anything over 50 L/h would result in a lot of bubbles but no water being pumped.

Result : 0.05 L in 3 mins 28.46 seconds 

So 0.05 L in 208.46 s aka 0.015 L / min aka 0.86 L per hour

...worst one so far
