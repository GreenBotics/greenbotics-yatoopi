##Lift-off!

Planting the (lettuce) seeds took place last week on the 2016-01-27

It was done using the following layout


| Lettuce Name | Symbol |
| ---          | ---    |
| lamb's lettuce | L |
| curly lettuce | C |
| Romaine | R |
| Frisee | F |
| basilicum | B |
| parsley   | P |


|---| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | L | L | L | R | R | C | P | P | 
| 2 | L | L | L | R | R |   |   |   | 
| 3 | L | L | L | R | R |   |   |   | 
| 4 | L | L | L | R | R | C | B | B | 



### Good news :

* The romaine already sprouted after less than **4** days. 
* Power consumption is hovering at around **115 W** for the system (lamps + water pump + air pump),
so this means this can possibly be covered by even a simple solar pannel setup

### The less good news: 

* I still have not completed the automated monitoring system (temperature, humidity, water depth in tank, wide angle camera), 
so detailed environemental tracking will not be available from the start , but given that this is an indoor setup, variations 
in the parameters should be minimal
* I have also attempted to install a basic Raspberry Pi + Webcam setup to have some nice remote viewing/timelapse capabilities, but the **very** cheap webcams I have , have very limited view angle, which makes them close to useless


### Next steps:

* watching things grow and going "this rocks, what an amazing level of growth" everyday !
* I have started to look into reusing an old ultrasonic sensor I have for the fishtank water level measurement 
* The [Arducam](http://www.arducam.com/)[ + Esp8266 combo](http://www.arducam.com/tag/arducam-esp8266/) also seems **very** interesting to say the least (even more so as you can more easilly change lenses, switching to a wide angle one) than with a basic webcam / RaspiCam
* I also **DO** intend to finish a basic version the monitoring setup's software side as soon as possible (whenever that might be)
