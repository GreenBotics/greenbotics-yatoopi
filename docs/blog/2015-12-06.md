##Upgrades, reboot etc


After a big failure last summer (most plants died) the grow system never really took off:

So here are steps to get everything (finally ?) going :

- switch to a more powerfull, WATER pump : airlift pumps are really great, but 
are not good enough with so little water depth (around 25 cm max in the current setup)
and are thus too sensitive to water level variations

- actually install a bell (or other) symphon system : this means changing most of the 3d printed plumbing
