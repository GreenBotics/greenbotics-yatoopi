##Bell syphon...or not


Verdict after running the bell syphon to a lot of different tests:
 it "works"...sorta:
- extremely finicky
- very limited range of flow rates that correctly triggers it
- outwards flow with this size is never sufficient : a inflow strong enough
to trigger the syphon is also also too much to reduce the water level in the container

This means ...Back to the drawing board!
A more mechanical system, but a less sensitive one seems a better bet
