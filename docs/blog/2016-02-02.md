##Liftoff!

Planting the (lettuce) seeds took place last week on the 2016-01-27 , using the following layout

| Lettuce Name | Symbol |
| ---          | ---    |
| lamb's lettuce | L |
| curly lettuce | C |
| Romaine | R |
| Frisee | F |
| basilicum | B |
| parsley   | P |


| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L | L | L | R | R | C | P | P | 
| L | L | L | R | R |   |   |   | 
| L | L | L | R | R |   |   |   | 
| L | L | L | R | R | C | B | B | 



### Good news :

* The romaine already sprouted after less than **4** days. 
* Power consumption is hovering at around **115 W** for the system (lamps + water pump + air pump),
so this means this can possibly be covered by even a simple solar pannel setup

### The less good news: 

* I still have not completed the automated monitoring system (temperature, humidity, water depth in tank, wide angle camera), 
so detailed environemental tracking will not be available from the start , but given that this is an indoor setup, variations 
in the parameters should be minimal
* I do intend to finish the monitoring setup (at least in a basic fashion) as soon as possible
(whenever that might be)
