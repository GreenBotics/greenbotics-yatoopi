#### Seperation of concerns etc

one very interesting aspect of airlift pumps is that it allows me to test
their 2 "parts" seperatly:

- the air pump
- the airlift system / pressure chamber

For the first phase of testing, I decided to use commercial (aquarium) air pumps
and see what results I can get : this allows a validation of the airlift system
without worrying about insuficient air pressure.

aka, science : it makes sense !


I tested with 16 mm pipes and the printed ##XXXX

Tested with 200L/h Eheim air pump

Result : 0.1 L in 2 mins 18.22 seconds 

So 0.1 L in 138.22 s aka 0.043 L / min aka 2.6 L per hour

Not so great in absolute terms but keep these things in mind : 

- the water is lifted 60 cm withouth any problems
- the whole plumbing is a prototype which means the joints are waterproof etc

#### Lobe pumps etc:

I also started researching some of the formulas behind lobe pumps
and creating the basics of a parametric design in .
