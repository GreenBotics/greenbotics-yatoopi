> aka: Yet another aquaponics project 

## Overview :

Here you will find all the files for this project:
cad, documentation, blog etc

### The aims are :

- open source
- low cost
- somewhat beginner friendly (I am one too)
- maximising re-use (for example I have a box
of 10 or so relatively small dc motors I intend to reuse for various purposes).
- use 3d printing "in a somewhat inteligent manner" : 
this means using it in a lot of cases where repeatable, cheap , reproductible, small /med run
of parts are needed, but not "forcing" its use either
- explore what is possible without massive amounts of store-bought equipment
- not reinvent the wheel whenever possible : I explore, test, modify, other people's
designs whenever possible
- "eco friendly"
- "self sufficient"
- note the quotes around the last two...


FYI , this whole thing is still in the very early stages, but for ONCE, I really
do not want to do documentation 2 years after I am fed up with a project: remember: 
"release early, release often, and DOCUMENT you efforts are least a bit".


## Sub pages etc

[testing](../master/docs/testing.md)


## Grow bed etc


 - the grow bed is build with wood and 3d printed parts
 - while not strictly necessary (you can build grow beds without 3d printing), 
 all the parts used either makes building easier, cheaper, or more practical.
 Also, they offer some esthetic/security benefits (rounded corners etc)
 
 Another important aspect of 3d printed parts: they can be build identically ,
 regardless of your tooling, as long as you have a 3D printer.
 
## cad files (3d printed)

  - for the [grow bed](../master/cad/growbed) (printed corners, assembly helpers)
  - for the [piping](../master/cad/piping) (outflow/drain and media guard )
  
  
assembly guides, pictures etc comming soon
